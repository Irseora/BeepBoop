- **Newton's Law of Gravity**
	- force between 2 massive bodies: $F = G M_1 M_2 / r^2$
	- expressing in terms of relative vector r, equation of motion: $d^2 r / d t + \micro r / r^3 = 0$
	  where $\micro = G(M_1 + M_2)$
	- shows that orbit of $M_2$ around $M_1$ is an ellipse, with $M_1$ focus
- **Kepler's Laws**
	- experimental, based on Tycho Brahe, applicable for planetary motion in solar system
	- 1st Law: The orbit of a planet is an ellipse, w/ the Sun at one focus
	- 2nd Law: A line segment joining the planet & the Sun, sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time
	- 3rd Law: The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit
- **Orbital Elements**
	- Shape & size of the ellipse:
		- Eccentricity (e)
		- Semimajor Axis (a)
	- Orbital Plane Orientation
		- Inclination (I)
		- Longitude of the ascending node($\Omega$)
	- Argument of periapsis ($\omega$) = orbit orientation in orbit plane
	- True anomaly (v) = location of secondary body

- **Sphere of Influence**
	- oblate-spheroid region around a celestial body
	- primary gravitational influence on orbiting object is that body
	- $r_{SOI} ~= a(m / M) ^{2/5}$
	- Given 2 large mass objects and a small object between them, which massive object should be use as the origin of the frame of reference? (Eg. Sending a probe from Earth to Mars)
	  The small object is within which massive object's SOI?
- **Hill Sphere**
	- region in which a body dominates the attraction of satellites
	- a moon has an orbit that lies in a planet's Hill sphere
	- $r_H ~= a (m/3M) ^{1/3}$
	- Given a large mass (Sun) and a small mass (Earth), can a tiny mass (Moon) find a stable orbit around the small mass?
	  If the tiny mass goes outside the Hill Sphere of the small mass, no
- **Lagrange Points**
	- points near 2 large orbiting bodies, where the gravitational force of the 2 large bodies & centrifugal force balance each other
	- small objects placed in orbit at a Lagrange point are in equilibrium in atleast 2 directions relative to the centre of mass of the large bodies => *excellent location for satellites*
	- Sun-Earth L1: SOHO, DSCOVR, LPF
	- Sun-Earth L2: Herschel, Planck, Gaia, JWST, Euclid
- **Orbit Classification**
	- *Altitude*
		- Low Earth Orbit (LEO): 200 - 1600 km
		- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO): 1600 - 35786 km
		- Geostationary Orbit (GEO): 35786 km
		- High Earth Orbit (HEO): > 35786 km
	- *Inclination*
		- Prograde/Retrograde: > / < 90 degrees
		- Polar: 90 degrees
		- Equatorial: 0 degrees
	- *Eccentricity*
		- Circular
		- Elliptic
		- Parabolic
		- Hyperbolic
		- Radial
	- *Synchronicity*
		- *Geostationary Orbit*: circular equatorial orbit w/ period of one sidereal day
			- sidereal day: 23 hours, 56 m, 4.1 s => altitude ~ 35786 km
			- from any point on Earth, a satellite in such an orbit is fixed at a given location
			- Uses:
				- Telecommunications: antennas on Earth will point to fixed locations in space to transmit/receive data
				- Meteorology: same Earth area can be observer continuously
		- *Sun-synchronous Orbit*: constant angle between orbital plane & mean Sun direction
			- nearly polar orbit around planet, in which the satellite passes over any given point of the planet's surface, at the same local mean solar time
			- Uses:
				- Earth observation (optical/spectrometers): same illumination conditions at specific points on ground in different passes (=> comparable images)
				- Earth Observation (radar): maximum efficiency solar panels, bcs. the eclipse time is minimum (short intervals during limited time of the year)
