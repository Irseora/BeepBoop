	- National Space Agencies
	- Large System Integrators (LSI)
	- Large Sub-System Suppliers
	- SME - specialized & critical components
	- Academia & Research
	- Launchers
- state budget

##### European Union Space Activities - EUSPA
- 2000s - EU GNSS: EGNOS & Galileo
- w/ ESA - Copernicus - Earth observation programme

##### European Union Space Programme
- EU $\ne$ ESA
- EU MS $\ne$ ESA MS
- Space programmes
	- GALILEO
	- EGNOS
	- COPERNICUS
- New Space Regulation
	- EUSPA
	- ESA - tech dev
	- EU & ESA & EUSPA - Financial Framework Partnership Agreement
- Budget: 13.2 b euro (2021 - 2027)

#### New Space - Uberisation of Space
- **Uberisation** = business model that cost-effectively leverages underutilized assets to completely *disrupt* an existing ecosystem
	- Disrupt <= New Space is doing things differently than Old Space
- emerged in the last decade
- Driven by
	- market needs (not gov. like old space)
	- lower costs
	- op. agility
	- private capital
	- entrepreneurial
		- efficiency-seeking innovation
		- new op. models
		- new R&D models
		- new organizational forms
		- non-governmental markets
		- independence from social / political goals
		- technological / process / organizational innovations from other industries

##### The CubeSat - Where It All Started
- turning point in new space history
- Universities - learning platform for students, cheap replica of an actual satellite ->
- Proof of concept - in-orbit validation / demonstration ->
- Low-cost experiments / science ->
- Real business cases / models ->
=> The need for technology

##### Private Space Economy

##### Satellite-Based Data & Services
- **Mega Constellations** = very large group of satellites working together
- Earth Observation
- Internet / Telecoms
- Tracking
- IoT & M2M (machine to machine comm.)
![[Pasted image 20221108211046.png]]
- Nr. of constellations / country (2019)
	- USA: 26 -> 17500+ satellites
	- China: 21 -> 3500+ sats.
	- Europe: 20 -> 2300+ sats.
	- Other: 15 -> 1200+ sats.

#### Space 4.0 - New Space, New People
- Change of paradigm:
	- Competition -> Cooperation
	- Limited acess -> Open acess
	- Restricted use -> Free use
	- Limited applicability -> Space is everywhere

##### Space vs. Global Challenges
- Climate change
- Migration
- Mobility
- Comms
- Energy
- Shortage of resources
- Demographiv development
- Conflicts & catastrophes
- Health
