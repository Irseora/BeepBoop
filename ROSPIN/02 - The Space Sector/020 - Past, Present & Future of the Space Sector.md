### [[023 - Present|Present of the Space Sector]]

### Future of the Space Sector
- 1st Stop: The Moon
	- Moon Village
	- Deep Space Gateway - for deep space missions, refueling stations
- Next Stop: Mars

#### In Earth Orbit
- *Megaconstellations*
	- direct to mobile phone signal
	- wildfire tracking
- *Space Tourism*
- *Private Space Stations*
	- Axiom Space - private ISS module
	- Blue Origin
	- Lockheed Martin

#### Issues for the Future
- Space debris: dead satellites, collisions, launcher parts, junk
- Space resource distribution & ownership
- Space weapons: anti-satellite rockets
- Space as *Critical Infrastructure* - disturbances & outages could have critical impact on Earth
- Cybersecurity - satellite hacking

### Key Ideas & Takeaway Points
- Space is Hard
- Space is Complex - everyone wants / needs a piece
- Space is *Critical Infrastructure* - "nice to have" -> "must have"
- New Space will increase in proportion in the space sector
- Space sector is booming, investment increasing & new uses of the space data / tech / applications are developed each day

1. Would it be hard for new mega constellations to compete w/ eg. Starlink? How hard would it be for it to launch?
	- differences in strategic value:
		- Starlink - nice to have, commercial
		- EU secure comm. network - must have, commercial + strategic => better kept & taken care of
	- way for EU to be independent
	- military component: NATO communications
	- multi-layer const.
	- space debris => all satellites have de-orbiting capability
2. How will ESA's major programmes look after November?
	- main directions the same
	- SOLARIS - develop technologies for solar powered space stations
	- development of nuclear / thermal power sources (batteries)
	- HERA launching
	- new Earth observation missions
	- independent EU access to space
	- test equipment in space
	- 5+ new astronauts - could participate in commercial missions
		- 1st paraplegic astronaut
3. How does the current war effect relations in the space sector?
	- cancellation of Roselin-Franklin Rover launch
	- coop. w/ Russia on ISS & launches
