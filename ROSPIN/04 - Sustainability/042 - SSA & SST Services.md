- Space Situational Awareness
- Space Surveillance & Tracking

#### ESA's SSA Programme
- until 2020: aquiring independent European capabilities to watch objects & phenomena that could harm spacecraft / ground infrastructure
	- *Space Weather (SWE)* - monotor & predict Sun & interplanetary & planetary environments
	- *Near-Earth Objects (NEO)* - detect natural objects (asteroids)
	- *SST* - watch for debris & spacecraft
- now: => Space Safety Programme: old SSA + space mission elements

- SST Sensors
	- Optical: telescopes
	- Radar
	- Laser
	- On-ground
	- In-orbit

#### Autonomous Collision Avoidance Systems (autoCOLA)
- ESA's decision parameters
	- Time of Closest Approach (TCA)
	- Radial & total miss distance
	- Covariance & state vectors @ TCA for chaser & target
	- Conjunction geometry
	- Probability of Collision (PoC)
- decision making is
	- complex & time consuming
	- expensive
	- high operational work-load
	- high human intervention
	- error prone

#### ESA's CREAM
- CREAM = Collision Risk Estimation & Automated Mitigation = automated collision avoidance
- Current activities
	- S2P/S1-CR-01: Automated Avoidance Manoeuvre Decisions & Design
	- S2P/S1-CR-02: Development & Testing of Late Commanding Paths & Operations Concepts
	- S2P/S1-CR-03: Means for coordination of operators & catalogue providers
