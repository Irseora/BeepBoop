### What is space?
- starts ~100 km above planet
- black bcs. of lack of oxygen
- vacuum, NOT empty
- Observable universe: 93 billion light-years ($8.8 \times 10^{26}$)

### Astronomy vs. Astrophysics
- *Astronomy* = study of universe beyond atmosphere
	- Branches: atrometry, celestial mechanics & astrophysics
- *Astrophysics* = branch of astronomy, physical processes

### [[011 - History of Astronomy|Brief history of astronomy & space observations]]

### [[012 - Celestial Objects|Celestial objects]]

### Planetary system formation
- 4.6 billion years ago
- part of the cloud collapsed in on itself => disk => nuclear fusion => sun
- protoplanetary
- only roky things could survive near the sun => terrestrial planets close, gas giants far

### Space observation & missions
- **How a telescope works**
	- curved mirrors/lenses gather & focus light = optics
	- Reflective telescope = uses mirrors, thinner & lighter than a lens
- **Equatorial Coordinate System**
	- Geocentric = origin at centre of earth
	- Fundamental plane = projection of Earth's equator into celestial sphere
	- Primary direction = towards vernal equinox
	- Coordinates: right ascension & declination
	- used by telescopes w/ equatorial mounts
- **Ecliptic Coordinate System**
	- Geocentric
	- Fundamental plane = the ecplictic (plane of Earth's orbit around Sun)
	- Primary direction = towards vernal equinox
	- Coordinates: ecliptic longitude & latitude
- **Galactic Coordinate System**
	- Heliocentric
	- Fundamental plane = parallel to the galactic plane
	- Primary direction = aligned with centre of Milky Way
	- Coordinates = galactic longitude & latitude
- **Space Telescopes**
	- Visible light: Hubble space telescope, Kepler, TESS, CHEOPS, COROT
	- InfraRed & Submm: IRAS, Spitzer, Herschel, WISE, James Web Space Telescope
	- X-ray: Einstein observatory, Chandra, XMM-Newton
	- Gravitational waves: LISA Pathfinder
	- To be lauched: Euclid, PLATO, ARIEL

### Space surveillance & tracking
- *Space surveillance* = comprehensive knowledge, understanding & maintained awareness of the population of space objects, space environment & existing threats & risks
- Detects & catalogues space debris, determines & predicts their trajectories => up to date catalogue
- Services:
	- Conjunction predictions = issuing warnings for potential collisions
	- Fragmentation detection = determine when a fragmentation occurs (collision / explosion)
	- Reentry prediction = determine orbital lifetime of an object & compute reentry data & trajectory
- **EUSST**
	- SST Consortium - 2014, EU
	- 7 member states:
		- France (CNES)
		- Germany (German Space Agency @ DLR)
		- Italy (ASI)
		- Poland (POLSA)
		- Portugal (PT MoD)
		- Romania (ROSA)
		- Spain (CDTI)
- **SST in Romania**
	- COSST - SST Operational Centre in Romania
	- ROSA - Romanian Space Agency
	- Operational data processing services
		- information processed, analysed, correlated & validated, then uploaded in the EUSST database
	- Support capacity for space debris monitoring, In-orbit Servicing (IoS) & Active Debris Removal (ADR)
