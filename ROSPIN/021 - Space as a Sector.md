- 1960s - the Space Race

##### Case Study: HERA Stakeholders
- **HERA** = European contribution to an international AIDA coop.
	- **AIDA** = Asteroid Impact Deflection Assessment, 1st planetary defense mission
1. (NASA) Kinetic impact on the smaller of the 2 bodies
2. (HERA) Detailed post-impact survey
   => well-understood & repeatable planetary def. technique
- **Objectives**:
	- *Asteroid Deflection*: Characterise DART kinetic impact & understand how to apply against a real threat
	- *Technology*: Validate on-board autonomy & close-proximity ops. + Demonstrate deep-space inter-satellite link with CubeSats
	- *Science*: Asteroid composition, formation of binary asteroid systems & clues on formation of our solar system

##### Case Study: EU Tech Independence Initiatives
- GALILEO - Guidance navigation system
- Copernicus - Earth observation system
- New Communications Mega-constellation
- Ariane Launchers
- Deployable Space Antennas
- Microelectronics for Space

#### Space Militarization
- Dec. 2019: space = NATO's "5th domain" of operations (land, sea, air, cyberspace)
- *Toulouse, France - NATO's center for excellence in military space*
	- Decided: 28. Jan. 2021
	- Announced: 4. Feb. 2021
- **USSF** = United States Space Force
	- space service branch of US Armed Forces
	- $\in$ 8 US uniformed services
	- 1st and only independent space force
	- $\in$ Department of the Air Force
		- one of 3 civilian-led departments in the Department of Defense

#### Boundaries (Space Law)
- UNOOSA - Main Principles - 1967
- similar to open-seas law
- exploration & use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit & in the interests of all countries & shall be the province of all mankind
- outer space shall be *free for exploration & use by all States*
- outer *space is not subject to national appropriation* by claim of sovereignty, by means of use / occupation, or by any other means
- States shall not place nuclear weapons / other weapons of mass destruction in orbit / on celestial bodies / station them in outer space in any other manner
- Moon & other celestial bodies shall be used excl. for peaceful purposes
- astronauts shall be regarded as envoys of mankind
- States shall be responsible for national space activities *whether carried out by governmental / non-governmental entities*
- States shall be *liable for damage caused by their space objects*
- Stated shall *avoid harmful contamination of space* & celestial bodies

#### Upstream / Downstream
![[Pasted image 20221108121929.png]]
- **Upstream** = everything to do w/ satellites, hardware, tech
- **Downstream** = result/information of that tech

#### General Segments of a Space System
![[Pasted image 20221108121959.png]]
- Space Segment = everything that gets to fly (hardware/software)
- Ground Segment = how data is gathered, how satellites are controlled, control centers
- User Segment = GPS, satellite dishes, internet

#### Why Space
- Space nav. (GPS, Galileo)
- Power grid management
- Telecommunications
- Broadcasting
- Meteorology
- Money transactions
