##### Ancient times
- Neprosite sky disk - 1600BC
- Petroglyphs (rock drawings)
- Babylonians - 1600BC
- Stonehenge - big computer for calculating planet positions

##### Hellenistic World
- Thales - 480 BC
	- natural phylosophist = data used to think of new experiments
- Eratosthenes & Aristarchus - 250 BC
	- size of Earth, Moon, Sun & distances using basic geometry
	-  Summer solstice @ noon:
		- in Alexandria: stick won't cast shadow
		- in Syene: shadow of 7 degrees
		- $\frac{C}{4900 stadia} = \frac{360 \ degrees}{7 \ degrees}$
- Hipparchus - 100 BC
	- I. star catalog & names of constelations
- Heraclides: Geocentric Solar System - 330 BC
- Aristarchus: Heliocentric Solar System - 270BC

##### Ptolemaic System
- Earth -> Moon -> Mercury -> Venus -> Sun -> Mars -> Jupiter -> Saturn
- Retrograde motion => doesn't work in a geocentric system

##### Copernican Revolution
- Copernicus: 1st to sucessfully formulate & publish
- Earth only the centre of local gravity & the Moon
- Orbits perfect circles
- Retrograde motion caused by motion of planets

##### Tycho Brahe
- 1580s
- First true observer -> built Danish observatory
- Geoheliocentric model
	- Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn orbit Sun
	- Non-moving earth

##### Johannes Kepler
- 1600s
- student of Tycho Brahe
- Laws of planetary motion: orbits of planets are ellipses

##### Galileo Galilei
- 1620s
- Sun spots
- Craters on the Moon
- Moons of Jupiter
- Phases of Venus - would be impossible if Venus orbited at constant distance from Earth

##### Sir Isaac Newton
- 1680s
- The Law of Universal Gravitation
- Laws of accelerated motion
- Father of calculus
- 1st reflecting telescopes

##### Modern Astronomy
- 19th & 20th century
- Frauenhofer: Spectral lines
	- proved the main elements in Sun exist on earth
- Radio astronomy

##### Cosmology & the expansion of the universe
- Sun part of a galaxy of > 10 billion stars
- Edwin Hubble - existence of other galaxies
- Physical cosmology - Big Bang Theory
	- Cosmic microwave background radiation

##### Brief telescope history
- Galileo - mountains & craters on the moon & the Milky Way
- Newton - reflecting telescope
- Space telescopes
	- bcs. Earth's atmosphere was distorting our view
- Radio, infrared, UV, X-ray
