- **Exoplanets** = planets outside solar system
- first detection
	- 2 planets orbiting pulsar PSR 1257+12
	- Aleksander Wolszczan & Dale Frail - 1992
- first detection orbiting a main sequence star
	- orbiting 51 Pegasi b
	- Michel Mayor & Didier Queloz 1995 => Nobel Prize in Physics 2019
- 5197 confirmed exoplanets in 3833 planetary systems
	- 840 systems contain > 1 planet
- **Methods for detecting**
	- **Radial velocity**
		- watching for wobble
		- orbiting stars cause stars to wobble => variation in speed of star moving towards or away from Earth
		- Doppler spectroscopy
			- everything moves in waves
			- *Doppler efect*: 
				- higher pitch while approaching, lower pitch while leaving 
				- *Redshift*: to determine if object is moving away or towards us
					- compacter waves = blue
					- stretched out waves = red
		- HARPS spectometer - La Silla Observatory, Chile
		- HIRES spectometer - Keck telescopes, Hawaii
	- **Transit photometry** 
		- *Light chart*: planet passing directly in front of star => blocks some light
		- radius of planet can be measured from depth of transit
		- light that passes through planet => atmosphere composition
		- Kepler mission, COROT, TESS
	- **Direct Imaging**
		- taking direct pictures of the exoplanetary system
		- use various techniques to reduce host stars glare
		- large planets (>= Jupiter) and far from their host star
		- Gemini Planet Imager, VLT-SPHERE, Subaru Telescope
		- very new
	- **Gravitational Microlensing**
		- light from a distant star is bent &focused by gravity as a planet passes between the star & Earth
		- like a magnifying glass
		- rare events, cannot be repeated
		- OGLE
	- **Astrometry** 
		- orbit of a planet causes a star to wobble in space in relation to nearby stars
		- requires extremely precise optics
		- very hard to do from Earth's surface bcs. of armosphere
		- usually combined with radial velocity
- **Exoplanet Characterization**
