#### Physiological Effects

##### Bone Loss
- adjusts strength in proportion to bone stress
	- **osteoblasts** = build bone
	- **osteoclasts** = build bone
- adjust thickness & shape depending on stress patterns
- microgravity - min. skeletal loading & decreased calcium
- change in bone distribution
