#### Components of ECLSS
- Environmental Control & Life Support
- *Environmental Monitoring*
	- partial pressure
	- total pressure
	- temperature & humidity
- *Atmospheric Management*
	- oxygen
	- carbon dioxide
	- trace contaminant & particulate control
	- filters
	- remove volatile gasses
	- ventilation
- *Water Management*
	- wastewater recycle
	- potable water
	- produce oxygen from water

#### Air Revitalization System
- periodic sampling & analysys on Earth
- **SAM** = Spacecraft Atmosphere Monitor - 2019
	- oxygen
	- carbon dioxide
	- nitrogen
	- methane
	- humidity
	- tiny gas chromatograph mass spectrometer

#### Oxygen Recovery
- Oxygen Generating Sysyem <-- Water Recovery System
	- electrolysis
	- reliant on Earth water
- **ACLS** = Advanced Closed Loop System - ESA
	- Carbon Dioxide Concentration Assembly
		- amine reaction
		- absorb & concentrate CO2 from air
	- Oxygen Generation Assembly
		- electrolysis
		- separate H - O
	- Carbon Dioxide Reprocessing Assembly
		- Sabatier reactor
		- react CO2 - H2 from OGA
		- => water & methane

#### Water Recovery
- Zvezda module
- water vapour - atmosphere --> emergency drinking water / O2 production
- in US segment
	- Urine Processor Assembly
		- low pressure vacuum distillation
		- centrifuge
		- recover ~70% water
	- Water Processor Assembly
		- filter gasses & solids
		- pass UPA water & waste water
		- gilter beds & high temp. catalytic reactor
		- water tested & cycled back
