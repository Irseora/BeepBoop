- **Celestial Object** = natural occuring physical entity, association, structure in the observable universe
---
- **NEBULA**
	- body of interstellar clouds
	- nebula = cloud (latin)
- **GALAXY**
	- gravitationally bound system of: stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, dark matter
	- galaxias = milky (greek?)
	- orbiting a centre of mass - ex. supermassive black holes
- **STAR CLUSTER**
	- large group of stars, born roughly at the same time
	- globular clusters (old)
	- open clusters (young)
- **PLANETARY SYSTEM**
	- gravitationally bound non-stellar objects, orbiting a star
	- Habitable zone: surface liquid water
- **STAR**
	- consists of a luminous spheroid of plasma, held together by its own gravity
	- the Sun: main sequnce star
	- begining: gravitational collapse of a nebula
	- mostly Hydrogen + Helium
	- shines bcs of thermonuclear fusion
	- end: stellar remnant
	- supernova explosions
- **PLANET**
	- astronomical body orbiting a star (remnant), that is:
		- massive enough to be rounded by its gravity
		- not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion
		- cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals
	- Types:
		- Gas Giants: large & low density -> Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
		- Terrestrial: rocky -> Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
	- Mercury & Venus have no moons
	- *Sad Story of Pluto*
		- 1930 - discovered & declared planet
		- 2006 - IAU formally defined "planet" => pluto dwarf planet
			- Mike Brown - How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming
		- Planet 9 - hypothetical planet in outer region of solar system - Mike Brown & Konstantin Batygin
- **MOON**
	- natural satellite: orbits a planet, dwarf planet, small solar system body
	- *Exomoons* = orbit exoplanets
- **ASTEROID**
	- minor planet
	- low mass, no atmosphere
	- asteroid belt - torus shaped (main belt)
	- asteroid mining -> hypothetical exploitation: high cost
- **COMET**
	- icy, small body, warms when close to the sun & releases gases
		- => produces a visible atmosphere = Coma / tail, due to solar radiation & solar wind
	- Rosetta mission - Comet 67P, organic compounds never seen before in comets + molecular oxygen
		- only one periodically visible with naked eye
		- originally from the Kyper belt
